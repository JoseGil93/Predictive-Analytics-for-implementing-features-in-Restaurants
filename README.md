# Predictive Analytics for implementing features in Restaurants

* These were 2 Projects done for me during my Master's Degree.
* The Tasks were developed by using RapidMiner. 
* This Assignments had the main purpose of analysing the success of implementing features such as online ordering and booking a table in the restaurants located in Bangladesh, India. Thus, Supervised and Unsupervised Learning algorithms were implemented, in order to take efficient decisions.

1. [Bangalore Restaurants: Data Exploration and SL Classification Models](https://github.com/JoseGil93/Predictive-Analytics-for-implementing-features-in-Restaurants/blob/master/218659676%20LP2%20Predictive%20(5).pdf)
* During this project, the data was explored in order to find correlations between attributes and some Supervised Machine Learning models were implemented.  

2. 
* In this project, it was required the implementation of Principal Component Analysis, PCA, in the Clustering Task for performing Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms, in order to analyse the customer reviews about the restaurants. The models implemented were optimised and tested by using performance metrics. Finally, the best model was deployed in
New Data in order to prove the capability of the model in making new predictions.
