# Predictive-Analytics-for-implementing-features-in-Restaurants
It was a Project from my Master's Degree. 
The Task was developed by using RapidMiner. 
This Assignment has the main purpose of analysing the success of implementing features such as online ordering and booking a table in the restaurants located in Bangladesh, India. 
During this project, the data was explored in order to find correlations between attributes and some Supervised Machine Learning models were implemented.
